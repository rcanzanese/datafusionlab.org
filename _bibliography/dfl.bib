The electromagnetic environment is primarily determined by the size of the cavity, effective conductivity, and leakage via apertures.

A software defined radio measurement platform was used to assess the communication performance through a selection of link-level metrics including error vector magnitude, post processing signal-to-noise ratio, and throughput. The degradation of link quality is quantified for increasingly diffuse environments, as well as the improvement when leveraging a maximal ratio combining receiver diversity scheme. The link quality was found to improve in both the reverberation chamber and the coupled cavity for larger effective apertures. This result was analyzed using a time-dependent model for RF propagation in coupled cavities.},

	abstract = {There is ongoing interest in designing data fusion systems that make use of human opinions (i.e.,"soft" data) alongside readings from various sensors that use mechanical, electromagnetic, optical, and acoustic transducers (i.e., "hard" data). One of the major challenges in the development of these hard/soft fusion systems is to determine accurately and flexibly the impact of human responses on the performance of the fusion operator. Examples, counterexamples, and thought experiments have been used to illustrate specific performance aspects of soft and hard/soft fusion operators. However, these methods do not provide a systematic means for calculating performance statistics. Data sets of human responses developed through human testing have also been used. However, results obtained in this manner were often hard to generalize and difficult to tune up due to the experimental and administrative limitations imposed on human testing. Models of human decision-making and confidence assessment from cognitive psychology offer a unique opportunity to assess the performance of fusion systems which make use of human opinions. Such models, which can programmed and modified readily and inexpensively, can be used to assess the performance of hard/soft fusion systems and to make credit assignments to the multiple sources of data that lead to the final estimate/decision of the fusion architecture. The main contribution of this thesis is a set of algorithms for determining the performance of various soft and hard/soft fusion operators using existing models of human decision-making. In the first part of the thesis, we discuss the current state of the art and introduce applicable techniques for hard/soft fusion. In the second part of the thesis, we present techniques and examples for determining the performance of a family of soft and hard/soft fusion operators on a set of binary and multihypothesis tasks. We also present a method for simulating "vague" human responses, and correspondingly assess the statistical performance of soft fusion systems that have been proposed for combining sources of such imprecise information.},

These antennas are capable of adaptively modifying their radiation characteristics and thus leverage pattern diversity to affect how the transmitter and receiver perceive the wireless channel. We propose a low complexity spatial AMC algorithm that uses the advantages of pattern reconfigurable antennas in concert with link adaptation to improve MIMO-OFDM link throughput. The algorithm operates in two main stages; First, it searches for the antenna configuration that yields the highest post-processing Signal-to-Noise Ratio (ppSNR) and, then, applies Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) to improve spectral efficiency. The performance of the proposed scheme is experimentally evaluated for a 2x2 MIMO-OFDM wireless system in an indoor environment. },

	abstract = {Implementation of WLANs in reverberant environments, such as industrial facilities, naval vessels, aircraft, and spacecraft, has proven challenging, because rich electromagnetic scattering can degrade link quality through multipath interference. As a result, the adoption of Wireless LANs in these environments has been slow. Previous studies concerning reverberant environments have focused on characterizing electromagnetic properties for the purpose of electromagnetic compatibility testing. Little attention has been given to the performance of wireless communications. In this effort, the effect of electromagnetic reverberance on wireless communications is investigated in order to assess the feasibility of WLAN deployment.

Work centered around two experimental measurement campaigns. The first campaign was performed in coupled reverberation chambers. The reverberation chambers provided a controllable environment which was configured to emulate the reverberance of below-deck spaces on a naval vessel. The process for quantifying and configuring the electromagnetic properties of a reverberation chamber is presented. The second campaign was performed on a naval vessel. Experimentation was conducted in a variety of locations on the ship. Locations were selected to represent a wide range of practical environments. Across both campaigns, several environment and node parameters were evaluated: level of reverberance, cavity coupling (effective aperture size), and LOS versus NLOS links. Additionally, advanced physical layer schemes and reconfigurable antennas are presented as methods to improve performance and mitigate multipath interference. To perform this work, a measurement platform and testing protocol were developed for systematic characterization of wireless communications in reverberant environments.

The primary contributions of this work are empirical characterization of wireless communications in reverberant environments, approaches to improving the performance of wireless communications in presence of high levels of multipath interference, and a methodology for experimentation in reverberant environments.},

	abstract = {The possible onset of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is an important consideration in the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics. In this study, several machine learning approaches are used to analyze CRS data. The analyzed data come from a human blood in vitro assay which was used to assess the potential of mAb-based therapeutics to produce cytokine release similar to that induced by Anti-CD28 superagonistic (Anti-CD28 SA) mAbs. The data contain 7 mAbs and two negative controls, a total of 423 samples coming from 44 donors. Three (3) machine learning approaches were applied in combination to observations obtained from that assay, namely (i) Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA); (ii) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by K-means clustering; and (iii) Decision Tree Classification (DTC). All three approaches were able to identify the treatment that caused the most severe cytokine response. HCA was able to provide information about the expected number of clusters in the data. PCA coupled with K-means clustering allowed classification of treatments sample by sample, and visualizing clusters of treatments. DTC models showed the relative importance of various cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10 to CRS. The use of these approaches in tandem provides better selection of parameters for one method based on outcomes from another, and an overall improved analysis of the data through complementary approaches. Moreover, the DTC analysis showed in addition that IL-17 may be correlated with CRS reactions, although this correlation has not yet been corroborated in the literature.},

	abstract = {Data transmission through metallic structures is commonly required in industrial control applications. In a number of these applications, mechanically penetrating the structure to pass cables and establish a wired communication link is either impossible or undesirable. Examples of such structures include metal bulkheads, pressure vessels, or pipelines. Ultrasonic signaling has been proposed as a solution for through-metal data transfer without penetrating the structure. The reverberant nature of the through-metal channel, however, can lead to significant intersymbol interference, limiting the data rate achievable by conventional single-carrier communication techniques. In this paper, we describe a through-metal communication technique that exploits the slow-varying nature of the ultrasonic channel to implement an orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing-based rate-adaptive peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction algorithm. Measurements of the proposed adaptive algorithm have demonstrated transmitted throughput rates of up to 14 Mbps while reducing PAPR by up to 3 dB and maintaining a bit error rate of 10- 5 at average transmit powers of roughly 6 dBm. This enhancement provides the required throughput and error rate to support high-rate network applications in otherwise data-limited environments.},

	abstract = {Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) RFID tags are passive, chipless tags that use discontinuities along a transmission line to create reflections. The discontinuities may be designed to produce a bipodal signal encoded with the unique identifier of the tag. When multiple tags are co-located and interrogated simultaneously, multiple access interference degrades the ability of the reader to detect the tags accurately. Reader detection can be improved by using spread spectrum signatures as the unique identifiers to limit interference. This work evaluates the ability of Gold codes and Kasami-Large codes to improve detection performance of a passive, chipless TDR RFID system. Simulations were conducted for varying numbers of simultaneously interrogated tags using synthetic tag responses constructed from the measured waveform of a prototype TDR tag. Results indicate that the Gold Code signature set outperforms the Kasami-Large Code signature set and a random, naïve set for simultaneous interrogation of less than 15 tags. For larger numbers of simultaneous tags, a random set performs nearly as well as the Kasami-Large Code set and provides more useful signatures.},

In order to mitigate these potential performance limitations, we examine the utility of alternative antennas on the infrastructure side of the wireless links.

	abstract = {A major hurdle in the development of soft and hard/soft data fusion systems is the inability to determine the practical performance gains between fusion operators without the burdens associated with human testing. Drift diffusion models of human responses (i.e., decision, confidence assessments, and response times) from cognitive psychology can be used to gain a sense of the performance of a fusion system during the design phase without the need for human testing. The majority of these models were developed for binary decision tasks, and furthermore, the few models which can operate on M-ary decision tasks are yet unable to generate subject confidence assessments. The current study proposes a method for realizing human responses over an M-ary decision task using pairwise successive comparisons of related binary decision tasks. We provide an example based on the two-stage dynamic signal detection models developed by Pleskac and Busemeyer (2010) where subjects were presented with a pair of lines on a computer screen, asked to determine which of two lines was the longest, and to assess their confidence in their decision using a subjective probability scale. M-ary human opinions were simulated for this line length task and used to assess the performance of several fusion rules, namely: Bayes{\textquoteright} rule of probability combination, Dempster{\textquoteright}s Rule of Combination (DRC), Yager{\textquoteright}s rule, Dubois and Prade{\textquoteright}s rule (DPR), and the Proportional Conflict Redistribution rule $\#$5.

	abstract = {Probability transformations provide a method of relating Dempster-Shafer sources of evidence to subjective probability assignments. These transforms are constructed to facilitate decision making over a set of mutually exclusive hypotheses. The probability information content (PIC) metric has been recently proposed for characterizing the performance of different probability transforms. To investigate the applicability of the PIC metric, we compare five probability transformations (i.e., BetP, PrPl, PrNPl, PrHyb, and DSmP) using a simulator of human responses from cognitive psychology known as two-stage dynamic signal detection. Responses were simulated over two tasks: a line length discrimination task and a city population size discrimination task. Human decision-makers were modeled for these two tasks by Pleskac and Busemeyer (2010). Subject decisions and confidence assessments were simulated and combined for both tasks using Yager{\textquoteright}s rule and mapped into subjective probabilities using the five probability transforms. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, normalized areas under the ROC curves (AUCs), along with average PIC values were obtained for each probability transform. Our results indicate that higher PIC values do not necessarily equate to higher discriminability (i.e., higher normalized AUCs) between probability transforms. In fact, all five probability transforms exhibited nearly the same normalized AUC values. At lower, fixed false alarm rates, the BetP, PrPl, PrNPl, and PrHyb transforms yielded higher detection rates over the DSmP transform. For higher, fixed false alarm rates, the DSmP transform yielded higher detection rates over the other four transforms. These trends were observed over both tasks, which suggests that the PIC may not be sufficient for evaluating the performance of probability tr},

Prolonged exposure to cerebral oxygen deficiency can lead to unconsciousness or even death. The onset of hypoxia in humans is of concern for those operating in high altitudes, and in military flights characterized by high-acceleration maneuvers. Using oximeters for measuring blood oxygen saturation levels is a common means to detect hypoxia in real time. Many types of oximeters can be used for this task but all are prone to complicated noise characteristics and bias inaccuracies. It may therefore be advisable to collect and combine data streams from multiple oximeters for more reliable Hypoxia/No Hypoxia decisions (compared to decisions made by a single oximeter). Here we develop statistical noise models for three popular types of oximeters (Respironics Novametrix 515B, Nonin forehead pulse oximeter 9847, and Masimo Rad-87). We also combine data streams from these oximeters using a Kalman filter. The result is a smooth and reliable estimate of blood oxygen saturation level which can be used to detect the onset of Hypoxia.},

	abstract = {In many biomedical studies, it is very important to identify the severity of certain disease classes or adverse reactions to treatments since the severity level associated to these entities influences choice of treatment plans. The processes of determining the severity scores are generally very time consuming and costly. This paper proposes a ranking approach to detect severity through distance metric learning. Based on sample groups of entities with known severity levels, a distance metric function is learned to describe the relationship between samples. Then this metric is used to measure the distances between entities of unknown severity versus the reference groups. The severity of the unknown disease class or adverse reaction is ranked according to these distances. We performed experiments on three different data sets and the results show that our approach correctly ranks the severity for the biomedical entities.},

	abstract = {We study design improvements for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communication systems that make use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Various Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) techniques were developed for such systems that load bits onto the subcarriers in a channel adaptive fashion in order to increase throughput. However, these techniques assume that the channel itself cannot be manipulated. Reconfigurable antennas are capable of adaptively modifying their radiation characteristics and thus leverage pattern diversity to affect how the transmitter and receiver perceive the wireless channel. In this paper, we propose a low complexity spatial AMC algorithm that uses the advantages of reconfigurable antennas in concert with link adaptation to improve MIMO-OFDM link throughput. First, this algorithm searches for the antenna configuration that yields the highest post-processing Signal-to-Noise Ratio (ppSNR). Then it applies AMC based on the ppSNR of the selected configuration and a Bit Error Rate (BER) constraint. The AMC stage uses fixed link tables defined by ppSNR regions for supportable spectral efficiencies to select the modulation and coding scheme for transmission. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme for a 2x2 MIMO-OFDM wireless system in an indoor environment.},

Most relevant studies involved experimentation with humans which is often expensive, subject to strict institutional regulations, and hard to validate and replicate. Here we make use of a mathematical model of human decision-making and human confidence assessment developed by Pleskac and Busemeyer (2010) in order to compare four types of fusion operators: (1) operators that use human-subject decisions (such as the k-out-of-N majority rule); (2) operators that use subject decisions and error rates (the Chair and Varshney fusion rule); (3) operators that use subject decisions and confidence assessments (Yager{\textquoteright}s rule and the Proportional Conflict Redistribution rule $\#$5); and (4) operators that use subject decisions, confidence assessments, and the average strength of each subject{\textquoteright}s confidence assessment, namely the average Brier scores (Dempster{\textquoteright}s rule of combination and Bayes{\textquoteright} rule of probability combination). The ability of each fusion system to discriminate between alternatives was determined by computing the normalized area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). When the number of sources used by the fusion algorithm exceeded five, fusion operators which made use of decisions and confidence assessments alone (i.e., type (3)) produced the lowest (namely, worst) normalized AUC values. Operators which made use of subject reliabilities (i.e., types (2) and (4)) produced larger (namely, better) normalized AUC values which, in addition, were similar to those of fusion algorithms that relied on decisions alone (i.e., type (1)). For the city size discrimination task studied by Pleskac and Busmeyer, these results suggest that as the number of sources increases, the importance of decision self-assessment diminishes.},

In this paper, we investigate the impact of the edge density on both LoP and the size of the largest component under the primary interference model, as the number of nodes in the network grows large. For Erd{\H o}s-R{\'e}nyi graphs, we employ threshold functions to establish critical values for the edge probability necessary for these properties to hold. These thresholds demonstrate that LoP and connectivity (or even the presence of a giant component) cannot both hold asymptotically for a large class of edge probability functions. A similar incompatibility for random geometric graphs is suggested by our simulation results.},

Continuous tracking of these devices provides an opportunity to verify the identity of a user, based on a profile of behavioral biometrics from the user{\textquoteright}s previous interaction with these devices. We propose a bank of sensors, each feeding a binary detector (trying to distinguish the authentic user from all others). In this study the detectors use features derived from the keyboard and the mouse, and their decisions are fused to develop a global authentication decision. The binary classification of the individual features is developed using Naive Bayes Classifiers which play the role of local detectors in a parallel binary decision fusion architecture. The conclusion of each classifier ({\textquoteright}authentic user{\textquoteright} or {\textquoteright}other{\textquoteright}) is sent to a Decision Fusion Center (DFC) where we use the Neyman-Pearson criterion to maximize the probability of detection under an upper bound on the probability of false alarms. We compute the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the resulting detection scheme, and use the ROC to assess the contribution of each individual sensor to the quality of the global decision on user authenticity. In this manner we identify the characteristics (and local detectors) that are most significant to the development of correct user authentication. While the false accept rate (FAR) and false reject rate (FRR) are fixed for the local sensors, the fusion center provides trade-off between the two global error rates, and allows the designer to fix an operating point based on hislher tolerance level of false alarms.

We formulate the concept of a target RF communication sequence signature which defines a specific sequence of communication signals, then use this concept to explore methods of detecting sequences of signals of interest. We present a review of features that would be useful in performing signal classification, and outline a methodology for extracting a particular feature (DTMF audio) from a signal.

The OMAN design engine works by taking a specification of network requirements and objectives, and allocates resources which satisfy the input constraints and maximize the communication performance objective. The tool is used to explore networking design options and challenges, including: power control, adaptive modulation, flow control, scheduling, mobility, uncertainty in channel models, and cross-layer design. The unaddressed niche which OMAN seeks to fill is the general framework for optimization of any network resource, under arbitrary constraints, and with any selection of multiple objectives. While simulation is an important part of measuring the effectiveness of implemented optimization techniques, the novelty and focus of OMAN is on proposing novel network design algorithms, aggregating existing approaches, and providing a general framework for a network designer to test out new proposed resource allocation methods. In this paper, we present a high-level view of the OMAN architecture, review specific mathematical models used in the network representation, and show how OMAN is used to evaluate tradeoffs in MANET design. Specifically, we cover three case studies of optimization. The first case is robust power control under uncertain channel information for a single physical layer snapshot. The second case is scheduling with the availability of directional radiation patterns. The third case is optimizing topology through movement planning of relay nodes.},

In the optimal reduced state estimator (ORSE) recently introduced by Mookerjee and Reifler, target maneuver is assumed to be a deterministic parameter in the plant model, equal to the maximum target acceleration. In this paper we exploit the steady-state equivalency of the Kalman filter and ORSE to derive an exact analytic expression relating the random tracking index of the Kalman filter, ΛR, and the deterministic tracking index of the ORSE, ΛD. The relationship offers a solution to a central problem in target tracking theory, namely how should the white plant noise level for a Kalman filter be selected for minimum mean square error state estimates in the presence of maximum target acceleration? Using the new relationship, a Kalman filter can be constructed with identical steady-state performance to the ORSE but without the additional computational complexity of the ORSE.},

This work focuses on the situation when opinions provided by observers are on frames which are hierarchically related. The goal is to develop a scheme for facilitating the representation and fusion of such complex opinions in a computationally tractable way. A framework based on tree structure is proposed where, unlike in existing works in the literature, every node in itself is a frame of varied refinement and not a subset of a fixed frame. Algorithms for belief mass propagation down the tree are developed. The proposed representation is shown to be applicable to various soft-soft and hard-soft fusion situations. Using the advantages of the organization of the tree, all belief combination calculations are performed using small frames and later combined together by a simple concatenation operation making the proposed scheme a computationally attractive framework.},

Transmission at high data rates is therefore difficult to achieve with traditional single-carrier systems. This paper applies an adaptive bit-loading technique to the transmission of digital signals through metal barriers using ultrasonic signaling. The multi-carrier approach discussed here allows us to mitigate severe frequency selectivity of the through-metal communication link and improve spectral efficiency by exploiting the stationary nature of the channel. Experimental performance of bit loading is examined in an ultrasonic through-metal channel. Our results indicate that non-power-scaled rate adaptive bit loading significantly outperforms non-adaptive modulation. Adaptive bit loading was shown to adhere to a strict BER constraint while increasing data rates by roughly 240\% from values of 5 Mbps to approximately 12 Mbps when compared to narrowband modulation techniques.},

	abstract = {Biomimetic robots are a new and challenging frontier for robotic systems. Designs inspired by nature are creating new approaches to problems such as to planetary surface exploration, minimally invasive surgery, or inspection of piping and cabling. However, these new biomimetic robotic systems are a challenge to design, simulate, and control. This paper presents a case-study in the design and physics-based simulation of a unique snake-inspired robot. The Drexel Snake Robot is a novel hybrid capable of both undulatory and rectilinear motion. In order to design gaits, test control algorithms and perform path planning for this robot, we develop a system-level physics-based simulation that captures engineering phenomena across many disciplines: mechanical, electrical, software, electronics, and the robot{\textquoteright}s external environment. As the snake robot moves, there is considerable slippage between its feet and the ground. Consequently, contact and friction forces play a significant role in dictating the path followed by the robot for a given set of joint motions. A closed-form equation (or set of equations) describing the robot{\textquoteright}s motion in this environment cannot be derived in a simple manner. Consequently, the material presented here are based the comparison of experimental and simulation results. While developing the simulation model, we detail the process of extracting necessary physical, kinematic and dynamics properties directly from the robot{\textquoteright}s computer-aided design. This process is not straightforward and the paper documents the issues and lessons learned that will be of use to others wishing to create full virtual models for their systems. Finally, we show how to calibrate the simulation model for fidelity and accuracy with several examples showing that it can be used to test gait and mobility patterns and identify nonobvious secondary phenomena to emerge from the design.},

Due to its flexible body structure, the snake also retains the ability to move without the aid of its feet, through internally induced bending motions - in this paper we focus specifically on a class of lateral rolling gaits. The motion planning framework is based on fitting the snake robot{\textquoteright}s kinematic structure to a three-dimensional spline curve passing through prescribed interpolation points. In the case of linear crawling, the curve defines a path to which the snake is fitted as it crawls forward. For a rolling gait, the curve is used to define the shape of the snake as it repeatedly rolls about its own center axis. The framework outlined in this paper can be adapted to a wide range of modular snake robots. Numerical results demonstrating the computation of joint angle trajectories for two different rolling gaits are presented.},

	abstract = {The adoption of IPv6 over its predecessor IPv4 has been a slow process despite that IPv6 offers many advantages is terms of flexibility, security, and routing in addition to a vastly larger addressing space. The disadvantage is that IPv6 needs a larger header size as well to provide these features.  A great amount of overhead accumulates for IPv6 transmissions with small packet sizes, such as network management and real-time traffic. Several header and payload compression techniques have been proposed to mitigate this effect. In this paper, the various compression techniques are identified and evaluated. A testbed was devised to further investigate a select set of protocols. Traffic shaping was used to impose non-ideal network constraints, such as delay, packet loss, and bit error. It was shown that header compression is highly effective at reducing overhead, especially for small packet sizes. RObust Header Compression (ROHC) was found to perform the best under network constraints with the exception of packet reorderings. Payload compression techniques were less useful as they require overhead in the form of either a per-packet dictionary or a synchronization mechanism, and the data payload cannot be previously compressed or encoded.},

Wireless communications would add flexibility and increase survivability; however, significant challenges to reliable wireless communications onboard naval ships remain. The hull of a naval ship exhibits an electromagnetic shielding effect that impedes the propagation of radio frequency (RF) signals. Watertight compartments often show high isolation from RF energy while the reverberant nature of ship compartments results in considerable multi-path fading. These effects combine to limit the bandwidth of the wireless channel and disrupt wireless network connectivity, reducing the usefulness of wireless networks.},

	year = {2010},
	month = {August},
	school = {Drexel University},
	type = {phd},
	abstract = {The need to transmit digital information across metallic barriers arises frequently in industrial control applications. In some applications, the barrier can be penetrated with wiring, while in others this may not be possible. For example, metal bulkheads, pressure vessels, or pipelines may require a level of mechanical integrity that prohibits mechanical penetration. This study investigates the use of ultrasonic signaling for data transmission across metallic barriers, discusses the associated challenges, and analyzes several alternative communication system implementations. Several recent e orts have been made to develop through-metal ultrasonic communication systems, with approaches ranging widely in bitrate, complexity, and power requirements. The transceiver designs presented here are intended to cover a range of target applications. In systems having low data rate requirements, simple transceivers with low hardware/software complexity can be used. At high data rates, however, severe echoing in the ultrasonic channel leads to intersymbol interference. Reliable high speed communication therefore requires the use of channel equalizers, and results in a transceiver with higher hardware/software complexity. In this thesis, issues related to the design of reliable through-metal ultrasonic communication systems are discussed. These include (1) the development of mathematical models used to characterize the channel, (2) application of equalization techniques needed to achieve high-speed communication, and (3) analysis of hardware/software complexity for alternative transceiver designs. Several groups have developed through-metal ultrasonic communication systems in the recent past, though none has produced a mathematical model that accurately describes the phenomena found within the channel. The channel model developed in this thesis can be used at several stages of the transceiver design process, from transducer selection through channel equalizer design and ultimately system performance simulation. Using this channel model, we go on to develop and test several ultrasonic throughmetal transceiver designs. Ultrasonic through-metal communication systems are finding use in a wide variety of applications. Some require high throughput, while others require low power consumption. The motivation for developing several designs ( ranging from low complexity, low power to high complexity, high throughput ) is so that the best design can be matched to each application. After these transceiver designs are developed, we present an analysis of their computational requirements so that the most appropriate transceiver can be chosen for a given application.},

To implement distributed computation in WSN, a multi-agent-based middleware was integrated into the model. It allows us to build a WSN system with efficient parallel processing capability and higher reliability of system operations. Moreover, we developed a unique mathematical framework to derive optimal sleep duty cycle using a reliability model referred to as generalize access structure congestion (G{\ensuremath{\Gamma}}C) system. Using these analysis results, we can determine an optimal power management schemes by computing an efficient duty cycle in any multi agent-based WSN.},

However, due to the unique traffic patterns exhibited by monitoring sensor networks, the lifetime of a large WSN is constrained by the burden placed on nodes near the sink node to forward additional traffic as more nodes are deployed. We discuss approaches for deploying a WSN that will maximize the lifetime of an initial deployment. We then consider cases where the mission lifetime is of a duration such that overdeploying an initial network to meet this mission criteria would become prohibitively expensive. We then propose a replenishment control framework where additional nodes are added to an initial deployment in consecutive batches in order to meet mission lifetimes while reducing cost. The control framework consists of a failure process model used to forecast sensor failures due to energy depletion, and a two-stage limited lookahead controller used to determine the number of nodes to be added to the network and the approximate locations of their deployment.},

They have also given educators the ability to convey advanced mathematical and engineering concepts in new ways and spend more time on analysis of engineering systems and less time on remedial mathematics. This new capability, which has become a fundamental tool for sophisticated designers in industry, is still not fully embraced in many engineering curricula. To exemplify the potential of scientific software in the engineering classroom, we describe a laboratory exercise conducted by second-year engineering students at Drexel University. It introduces a geosynchronous satellite orbital entry problem, and demonstrates how scientific software can help students understand the behavior of an interesting physical system in a way that would have required much more effort using traditional methods. We believe that early introduction to symbolic computation tools and scientific software would be very valuable to engineering students. Such tools should become standard instruments in the arsenal of present-day engineers. Moreover, their use should be adopted across the curriculum (not only in introductory mathematics classes) and become part of the design experience in all engineering disciplines.},

	abstract = {As low cost, low power wireless networking technologies continue to gain popularity in industrial control and remote sensing applications, greater demand is being placed on network reliability and robustness. The numerous metallic objects found in many industrial environments can make reliable RF coverage difficult to obtain. In cases where system components are physically isolated from one another by metallic barriers (e.g. bulkheads or storage tank walls), direct RF communication between components is not possible. Prior research into the use of ultrasonic signaling as a means of passing data across metallic barriers has proven successful, but it has been observed that acoustic echoing in the channel leads to significant intersymbol interference (ISI) when symbol rate approaches the hundred kilosymbol/second range. An echo cancelation technique was developed to partially suppress these echoes, but its performance was limited due to simplicity of the channel model used. In this paper, we develop a more accurate channel model and use it as the basis for constructing an improved echo cancelation pulse. The new pulse suppresses echoes to a level comparable to the RMS noise amplitude of the channel, greatly reducing ISI. The resulting transceiver is capable of transmitting data at over 5 Mbps using simple pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). This technique thus represents a data rate increase by a factor of five over prior work.},

In our projects 4th year, we reached a stage where we could implement a semester-long pilot on cellphone-based learning. The pilot study took the form of an after-school program in a village in India. This paper reports on this summative learning assessment. While we found learning benefits across the board, it seemed that more of the gains accrued to those children who were better equipped to take advantage of this opportunity. We conclude with future directions for designing educational games that target less well-prepared children in developing regions.},

Each robot must follow a fixed and known path, arrive at its goal as quickly as possible (or at least not increase the time for the last robot to arrive at its goal) and stay in communication with other robots in the arena throughout its journey. The main contribution of this paper is the formulation of the problem as a discrete time nonlinear programming problem (NLP) with constraints on robot kinematics, dynamics, collision avoidance, and communication connectivity. We develop partition elimination constraints that assist in ensuring that the communication network is fully connected (no network partitions). These constraints are enforced only when network partitions would otherwise occur, an approach which significantly reduces the problem size and the required computational effort. In addition, we introduce path-constrained jammer robots with known paths and velocity profiles into the scenario. These jammer robots have an effective jamming range and disrupt all communications within this range. Except for the jammers, all robots must remain outside this jamming range at all times. We investigate the scalability of the proposed approach by testing scenarios involving up to fifty (50) robots. Solutions demonstrate (i) the trade off between the arrival time and the communication connectivity requirements in scenarios with and without jamming; and (ii) the dependence of computation time on the number of robots.},

Through optimization of the lifetime expression over both variables and through simulation results, it is shown that 1) a differential node deployment with a uniform cluster-head density increases the lifetime of the network over a uniform deployment and 2) the addition of a suitable differential cluster-head density further increases lifetime over the differential node deployment with uniform cluster-head density.},

In this paper, we introduce a radio to radio (R2R) factor that quantifies the interference effects of one radio waveform on another based on multiple waveform properties instead of solely on intermediate frequency (IF) signal power. The R2R factor is formulated as a dimensionless correction term in the victims communication link budget. The factor provides an effective interference margin in the link budget, taking into account modulation schemes, frequency offset, and power offsets of the intended source of communication ({\^A}{\textquestiondown}victim{\^A}{\textquestiondown}) and the interferer. For a specified set of modulation parameters we simulate a scenario where the victim signal is interfered by the interferer signal. The interfered victim signal is then demodulated by the intended receiver in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The sent and received data streams are compared to determine a bit error rate (BER) induced by the interference. This BER is then mapped to an effective signal to noise and interference ratio that produces the same BER in an AWGN channel. The R2R factor is then the difference between this effective signal to noise and interference ratio and the actual signal to noise and interference ratio of the communication link. In this paper we demonstrate how the R2R factor may be computed, and show examples for several cases of victim and interferer modulations.},

The scenario we study is that of a swarm of robots, all with wireless communication capabilities. Some of the robots are equipped with video cameras and are thus considered sensors. A few select robots have sufficient battery and computational power to perform machine vision processing of the video stream. The goal of this scenario is to get the video from the sensors to the video-processing robots, which can then extract high-level surveillance information about the observed environment. We present an optimization framework for minimizing redundant visual data transmissions, while maximizing the throughput from sensors to processing nodes.

	abstract = {Movement and allocation of network resources for a system of communicating agents are usually optimized independently. Path planning under kinematic restrictions and obstacle avoidance provides a set of paths for the agents, and given the paths, it is then the job of network design algorithms to allocate communication resources to ensure a satisfactory rate of information exchange. In this paper, we consider the multiobjective problem of path planning for the sometimes conflicting goals of fast travel time and good network performance. In previous work we considered this problem under the assumption of full knowledge of network topologies and unlimited computational resources. In this paper, nothing is known a priori about topology, information is exchanged between nodes within a connected component of the network, and sources of environment-dependent communication failure can only be approximately estimated through learning. All the planning must be done online in a distributed fashion. We apply ant colony optimization to this problem of planning under uncertain information, and show that significant benefit in network performance can be achieved even under the difficult conditions of the scenario. Furthermore, we show the ability of nodes to quickly learn the communication patterns of the arena, and use this information for improved path planning.},

The problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) with constraints on the kinematics, dynamics, collision avoidance and communication. Solutions demonstrate the trade off between the arrival time, the required transmission power and the communication connectivity requirements.

	abstract = {In this paper, we use reliability theory to determine the answer of an important question about how often we need to update a piece of secure information. For example, one may need to determine an appropriate time for updating a new password. To generalize, we compute an efficient updating time for a dependable secure computing (DSC) system which stores secret information in a reliable and secure fashion among n servers. The secret information can be reconstructed by successfully connecting to any k servers (k {${\l}eq$} n), but cannot be revealed by using (k ? 1) or fewer servers. Generally, the secret information has to be updated in the system in order to prevent adversaries from learning secret information by breaking into k servers in a DSC system. There are serval proposed procedures to update secret information, but few has been able to determine what an appropriate updating time on a DSC system is. To achieve the most reliable way to safeguard the secret information, we developed an interesting approach to compute the updating time on a DSC system from the reliability point of view.},

	abstract = {Robots that mimic the natural motions of animals have long been of interest in science and engineering. The primary engineering interest in such robots is in having them conduct tasks that require complicated locomotion and cognition. The biological creatures after which the human-made robots are designed manifest a remarkable degree of efficiency and agility when compared to what we have been able to mimic so far in human-made designs. For example, the small cross-section and low center of gravity of most biological snakes, coupled with their large repertoire of possible motion sequences, make their bodies very efficient when navigating confined spaces and rough terrains. To date, no ?artificial? snake has been able to come close to duplicating these navigational characteristics. In this study we concentrate on a set of motions observed in medium size (1-4m) iological snakes. There are currently several robot designs that attempt to reproduce the movements of such snakes. Almost all of these designs require the robot to articulate segments of its body in a repetitive sequence to achieve locomotion, and some even attach passive wheels to the snake?s body in order to facilitate movement. As a result of these design decisions, the artificial snakes are generally slow and most (especially those with wheels) are not well suited for travel over rough terrain. We offer an alternative design that propels the snake using many small feet attached to disk-like body units (?ribs?). Due to the superior flexibility that this design provides, the resulting robot, which we have built and tested, can actually ?walk? over obstacles and therefore will be much more maneuverable than existing prototypes.},

	abstract = {In mobile wireless IP networking domains (i.e., MANETs), the network topology may be frequently changing due to node mobility. Under such network dynamics, simulation has shown that the OSPF routing protocol performs poorly (e.g., increased overhead and data loss), but can be modified with ?MANET extensions? to better its performance. To provide complementary validation of these observations, this paper separately measures the routing protocol overhead generated by OSPF and its MANET extensions due to node mobility using an emulation testbed. The networking experiments were constructed using several off-the-shelf Linux workstations interconnected by Ethernet. Several modeling efforts were necessary to represent the network under test?s partial mesh connectivity, wireless interfaces, and node mobility on the immobile, non-wireless testbed. To validate these modeling efforts, the experimental results from the emulation testbed were cross-validated against OPNET simulation. For networks under test of increasing size, our emulation (and simulation) testing showed that the MANET extensions to OSPF consistently exhibited lower amounts of routing protocol overhead, and lower growth trends, when compared to OSPF. Our emulated results reaffirm previous simulation efforts.},

In this environment, metal bulkheads (which divide the ship into watertight compartments) and other metallic obstacles can lead to unreliable network connectivity. We propose to address the challenge by augmenting the RF network with ultrasonic data repeaters. The repeaters are designed to pass data from one side of a watertight bulkhead to the other without requiring the bulkhead to be physically penetrated. Through experimentation, we observed that echoes of pulses transmitted through the ultrasonic channel (i.e. the bulkhead) lead to considerable intersymbol interference and hinder high data rate transmission. In this paper, we investigate the nature of this interference and propose a method of mitigating its effect. The method applies a pre-distortion filter to the data which leads to destructive interference that reduces the echo amplitude.},

We find that ADS and MDS outperform these existing criteria. When high-sensitivity screening is required, ADS appears to be preferable to WTS. When a false positive rate (FPR) similar to WTS is desired, MDS should be used. The popular Wilcoxon rank sum is a more conservative approach that should be employed when the lowest FPR is desired, even at the expense of lower true positive rate (TPR). ICE is a less desirable criterion because it does not perform well for data generated by the normal model. FCS gave results similar to those of WTS. Evaluation of these algorithms using real biological datasets showed that ADS and MDS flagged several biologically significant genes that were missed by WTS, besides selecting most of the genes that are also selected by WTS},

In this paper we provide a literature survey of autoconfiguration schemes designed for MANETs. In addition, we look at a specific stateless autoconfiguration scheme (by Jelger and Noel, SECON 2005). This scheme provides globally routable IPv6 prefixes to a MANET, attached to the Internet via gateways. We examine this approach through OPNET simulation, applying new mobility models to encourage squad-like clusters around gateways, introducing mobility to the gateways, and scaling the number of ad hoc nodes and the number of gateways independently. We then comment on the performance of the Jelger-Noel addressing scheme in terms of protocol overhead, autoconfiguration time, prefix hold times, and prefix stability.},

Concepts from optimal control theory are used to implement individual controllers. The proposed framework is highly scalable, naturally tolerates controller failures and allows for the dynamic addition/removal of controllers during system operation. As a case study, we apply the control framework to minimize the power consumed by a computing cluster subject to a dynamic workload while satisfying the specified quality-of-service goals. Simulations using real-world workload traces show that the proposed technique has very low control overhead and adapts quickly to both workload variations and controller failures.},

The main objective was to minimize detection time of a NBC sensor network for attacks on a generic urban environment. To this end we conducted simulations in such environments using thirty-three (33) unique attack locations, thirty-three (33) candidate sensor locations, prevailing wind conditions, and the properties of the chemical agent, chlorine gas. A total of ninety-nine (99) simulated attack scenarios were created (three sets of thirty-three unique attack simulations) and used for optimization. Simulated chemical agent concentration data were collected at each candidate sensor location as a function of time. The integration of this concentration data with respect to time was used to calculate the contaminant "consumption" of the network and the sensor placement algorithm, along with contaminant-level detection, minimized consumption to the network while also minimizing the number of sensors placed. Our results show how a small number of properly placed sensors (eight (8), in our case) provides the best achievable coverage (additional sensors do not help)},

	abstract = {We propose a pattern recognition framework for the identification of biologically interpretable regions of difference between groups of flow cytometric data samples. The identification of regions of difference is reduced to a problem of feature selection. We propose the use of a filter-based feature selection method using the two sample t-test to identify relevant features. We compare the performance of our method to an existing alternative, Frequency Difference Gating (FDG), and to other commonly used feature selection methods including filter-based methods such as a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, a non-parametric resampling based Welch t-test, the Pearson?s square correlation coefficient and a wrapper method using support vector machine based recursive feature elimination. We evaluate the performance of the various methods using commonly used feature selection metrics, feature selection accuracy and classification accuracy. We also present the use of a metric from signal detection theory, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC), to evaluate the feature selection performance. Using these metrics, we demonstrate that the pattern recognition framework using the filter based tests outperform FDG and the wrapper based method. We show the performance using synthetically generated data and real biological data obtained from treating mice with an agonistic anti-CD3 antibody to determine activation levels in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. We find that our method is able to identify all the regions of differences between the two groups of samples. The pattern recognition framework is also used to analyze regions of differences in data collected from mice treated with an agonist (drug), erythropoietin (EPO). The regions of difference detected represent cells known to be affected by EPO. Using a possibilistic clustering algorithm, we identify the presence of four cluster of cells within our regions of difference, that respond differentially to EPO. The identity of the cells was determined by physically separating the cells of interest from the mixture and studying their morphology. In this experiment the technique provided us with information that EPO acts by stimulating and expanding basophilic erythroblasts in mice bone marrow.},

	abstract = {In this paper we apply robust optimization techniques to the problem of power control in mobile ad hoc wireless networks. Our approach is inherently multi-objective in that we seek a solution set that trades off the dual objectives of achieving optimality and maintaining feasibility. In particular, our objective is to minimize the aggregate power employed by the transmitters and the constraints are that the SINR at each receiver must exceed the threshold required for successful reception. The selection of the powers is complicated, however, by the fact that the channels incorporate random and unknown fading and attenuation components. A robust optimization framework for this problem is developed that penalizes the expected infeasibility of the proposed solution. The "cost of uncertainty" is measured by the total additional power required when all channel states are known. Our results demonstrate that communication dependability is enhanced through the robust formulation.},

However, the majority of its benefits have been concentrated in industrialized nations and therefore limited to a fraction of the world{\textquoteright}s population. We believe that technology has a large role to play in developing regions, that "First World" technology to date has been a poor fit in these areas, and that there is thus a need for technology research for developing regions. Despite the relative infancy of technology studies in developing regions, anecdotal evidence suggests that access to technology has a beneficial economic impact. Cellular telephony is probably the most visible application, but there are many others, some of which we cover in this article. The World Bank{\textquoteright}s infoDev site catalogs hundreds of information and communications technologies (ICT) projects, albeit not all successful. Most of these projects use existing off-the-shelf technology designed for the industrialized world. Although it is clear that there are large differences in assumptions related to cost, power, and usage, there has been little work on how technology needs in developing regions differ from those of industrialized nations. We argue that Western market forces continue to meet the needs of developing regions accidentally at best.},

The PA-UWNT is a mobile ad hoc network (manet) comprising mobile computers (PDAs, tablets, and laptops) and Web service-based applications. Our experience in the PA-UWNT project indicates that constructing such systems will require new research developments in computer networking, agent and service-based computing, and security that integrate each of these disciplines at several fundamental levels.

As mobile computing becomes ubiquitous, MANETS becomes increasingly important. As a design paradigm, multiagent systems (MASs) can help facilitate and coordinate ad hoc-scenarios that might include security personnel, rescue workers, police officers, firefighters, and paramedics. On this network, mobile agents perform critical functions that include delivering messages, monitoring resource usage on constrained mobile devices, assessing network traffic patterns, analyzing host behaviors, and revoking access rights for suspicious hosts and agents. Agents can effectively operate in such environments if they are environment aware - if they can sense and reason about their complex and dynamic environments. Altogether, agents living on a MANET must be network, information, and performance aware. This article fleshes out how we apply this approach to populations of mobile agents on a live MANET.},

	abstract = {The envisioned use of sensor networks for military and civilian applications calls for the deployment of a large number of sensors for extended periods over wide geographical areas. Due to energy and bandwidth constraints, most sensor fields would be "dormant," initiating communication only when a threat is detected. Many architectures under consideration call for compression of locally sensed data into binary "target/no target" decisions. These schemes use a common channel for communication between local detectors (LDs) and the decision fusion center (DFC) that integrates the multiple detector decisions. Unlike most parallel fusion schemes, which use a dedicated communication channel between every LD and the DFC, sensor fields would employ a single shared, time-slotted communication link for all LDs to transmit decisions to the DFC. In this paper, we introduce two window-based methods for managing traffic over this channel. The first allows simultaneous messages to collide. The DFC uses the statistics of the channel states (i.e., the numbers of successful transmissions, idle slots, and collisions during a specified time period) to make its global target/no target decision. The second method uses a simple collision resolution algorithm (CRA), similar to slotted-ALOHA, with dynamically updated retransmission probability. With this scheme, the DFC makes its decision based on data communicated successfully within a specified time window. Overall performance of the two approaches are presented and compared. Simple rules are developed for assessing the conditions under which each one is preferred.},

	abstract = {Security of an agent system is often limited, relying on basic cryptographic techniques without consideration of issues such as key maintenance, forming and communicating in secure groups, or interlayer security. From a security engineering perspective, multi-agent systems introduce new channels and possibly layers, resulting in additional security concerns. A comprehensive security engineering perspective - studying the information flow of the multi-layered system, identifying, analyzing and addressing multi-level security threats - is rarely taken. This paper presents a security engineering process for multi-agent systems - motivating the need for comprehensive security engineering and showing how to proceed with the process within an agent system. One of the largest obstacles in security engineering is understanding how to decompose a system into the parts that require security. This paper provides a decomposition for agent systems that can be directly applied to the security engineering process. Examples are given that detail the application of the presented security engineering process to: 1) a FIPA-compliant agent system; and 2) peer-to-peer content lookup. The most important contribution of this paper, is proposing a formal approach to addressing security within an agent system, where there exist unique and application-specific threats that must be addressed.},

The method is based on gathering and inspecting a set of image relevant features from the pixel groups of the stego-image, whose similarities and correlations change with different ratios of LSB embedding. The proposed detection scheme is based on support vector regression (SVR). It is shown that the measurement of a selected set of features forms a multidimensional feature space which allows estimation of the length of hidden messages embedded in the LSB of cover-images with high precision.},

Unlike most parallel fusion schemes, which use a dedicated communication channel between every local detector (LD) and the data fusion center (DFC), our scheme uses a single shared, time-slotted communication link for all LDs to transmit decisions to the DFC. Two window-based methods are presented for managing traffic over this channel. The first allows simultaneous messages to collide. The DFC uses the statistics of the channel states (i.e., the number of successful transmissions, idle slots, and collisions during a specified time period) to make its global decision. The second method uses a simple collision resolution algorithm (CRA), similar to slotted-ALOHA with dynamically updated retransmission probability. With this scheme, the DFC makes its decision based on data transmitted successfully within a specified time window. Over-all performance of the systems are presented and compared. Simple rules are developed for assessing the conditions under which each one of the schemes is preferred.},

We derive the equations of motion for an automated NFT (ANFT) using a Lagrangian formulation. These equations, which represent a simplified first-order model of the dynamics, are used to simulate the ANFT using the software package Simulink. Two control schemes are examined: proportional plus integral plus derivative (PID) control and dynamic inversion. Both are simulated for setpoint and tracking control. It appears that PID control is preferred due to its simplicity of design and relative insensitivity to the dynamic model of the ANFT.},

All LDMs survey a common volume for a binary {H0, H1} phenomenon. Each LDM forms a binary decision: it either accepts H1 (target-present) or H0 (target-absent). The LDM is fully characterized by its performance probabilities. The decisions are transmitted to the DFC through noiseless communication channels. The DFC then optimally combines the local decisions to obtain a global decision which minimizes a Bayesian objective function. The DFC remembers and uses its most recent decision in synthesizing each new decision. When operating in a stationary environment, our architecture converges to a steady-state decision LDM in finite time with probability one, and its detection performance during convergence and in steady state is strictly determined. Once convergence is proven, we apply the results to the detection of signals with random phase and amplitude. We further provide a geometric interpretation for the behaviour of the system},

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) requires strict attention to synchronization to maintain the orthogonality of subchannels. Pollet et al. (1995) pointed out the severe nature of a frequency offset impairment in the OFDM receiver. However, even if zero frequency error is achieved, frequency conversion for RF or microwave channels unavoidably imposes phase noise, a portion of which is untracked and contributes to BER performance degradation. The situation can be magnified by low cost RF synthesis techniques used in commercial communications, and the increasing sensitivity of M-QAM to phase jitter as M increases. The paper considers the bit-error rate (BER) performance of OFDM systems, taking into account the important relationship between the rate of the jitter process, and the OFDM subchannel baud rate. For OFDM, in order to properly characterize the degradation, four important items must be understood: nature of the untracked phase jitter; single carrier M-QAM phase noise performance; multicarrier interference effect (interbin interference); and relationship of phase jitter rate to subchannel baud rate. Each of these is discussed, and the results used to generate BER performance expressions},

	abstract = {Since the introduction of fuzzy clustering by Ruspini (1970), fuzzy logic has provided a family of interesting clustering algorithms which expanded the abilities of {\textquoteleft}crisp{\textquoteright} techniques. The most popular among these algorithms is the fuzzy c means algorithm (FCM). However, FCM and most of its variants are sensitive to the presence of outliers in the data set. Past attempts to reduce this sensitivity included the addition of a {\textquotedblleft}noise cluster{\textquotedblright} and the introduction of measures that assess the typicality of a vector to a cluster. In this study we provide additional means for outlier rejection through the introduction of a new variable, the credibility of a vector. Credibility measures the typicality of the vector to the entire data set (not to specific subsets as some previous techniques have done). An outlier is expected to have a low value of credibility compared to a non-outlier. The use of the new variable leads to the credibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm},

	abstract = {Probabilistic clustering techniques use the concept of memberships to describe the degree by which a vector belongs to a cluster. The use of memberships provides probabilistic methods with more realistic clustering than {\textquotedblleft}hard{\textquotedblright} techniques. However, fuzzy schemes (like the fuzzy c means algorithm, FCM) are often sensitive to outliers. We review four existing algorithms, devised to reduce this sensitivity. These are: the noise cluster (NC) algorithm of Dave (1991), the possibilistic c means (PCM) scheme of Krishnapuram and Keller (1996), the least biased fuzzy clustering (LBFC) method of Beni and Liu (1994), and the fuzzy possibilistic c means algorithm of Pal et al. (1997). We then propose the new credibilistic fuzzy c means (CFCM) algorithm to improve on these methods. It uses a new variable, credibility of a vector, which measures the typicality of the vector to the whole data set. By taking credibility into account CFCM generates centroids which are less sensitive to outliers than other techniques, and closer to the centroids generated when the outliers are artificially removed},

The navigating point must meet a goal point at a fixed time T, while avoiding several translating, nonrotating, nonintersecting obstacles on its way. All obstacles, the goal point, and the navigating point are confined to the interior of a star-shaped set in RN over the time interval [0, T]. Full a priori knowledge of the goal{\textquoteright}s location and of the obstacle{\textquoteright}s trajectories is assumed. We observe that the topology of the obstacle-free space is invariant in the time interval [0, T] as long as the obstacles are nonintersecting and as long as they do not cover the goal point at any time during [0, T]. Using this fact we reduce the problem, for any fixed time t0∈[0, T], to a stationary-obstacle problem, which is then solved using the method of Rimon and Koditschek. The fact that the obstacle-free space is topologically invariant allows a solution to the moving-obstacle problem over [0, T] through a continuous deformation of the stationary-obstacle solution obtained at time t0. We construct a vector field whose flow is in fact one such deformation. We believe that ours is the first global solution to the moving-obstacle path-planning problem which uses vector fields},

The method of calculating these matches over an entire stereo image pair usually depends upon the application for which the resulting depth information will be used. Functional minimization and dynamic programming are two widely used techniques for selecting matches. We present an alternative technique based on an integer programming formulation of the correspondence problem. Computation of the disparity map is accomplished in polynomial time by casting the selection of matches along corresponding epipolar lines as the problem of finding a maximum weighted matching on bipartite graphs. This approach incorporates several desirable properties of disparity maps, including implicit occlusion estimation, preference for fronto-parallel surfaces, and improved performance in the absence of texture (when compared to non-global techinques which do not maximize over the entire epipolar line)},

We present results for a version of this problem called the special global problem, (SGP) where the lower end of the range is empty and the higher end of the range is a closed and regular ldquo;legal rdquo; language. To this end, online local supervisors are synthesized that generate a language that contains the supremal closed controllable and strongly decomposable (supCCSD) sublanguage of the legal language. We accomplish this task through a new, more general decentralized supervisory control architecture involving decision fusion. We formulate two problems that extend GP and SGP. These are GP with fusion (GPF) and SGP with fusion (SGPF). Our main result is a set of local supervisors that solve SGPF for any k-out-of-n type event fusion rule. This result is of particular interest when more than one supervisor has control over the same event. Furthermore, the local supervisor designs are decoupled, thus the (online) computation of local supervisors can be performed in a distributed manner},

An example using the IEEE 14-bus system serves to demonstrate the potential of the DES formulation in the control of power networks, and to introduce the basic tools and techniques that this formulation offers. Unlike other types of controllers, a DES-based supervisory controller does not serve to specify the exact control action at each state of the network. Rather, it defines an envelope of allowable actions. Within that envelope, local controllers make specific decisions to satisfy local performance indices. This approach allows the creation of multi-level nonconflicting hierarchical control procedures, which are particularly attractive in the management of large-scale systems. Each level in the hierarchical control structure defines the envelope of operation for the lower-level controllers through the enabling and disabling of controllable events. Component failure such as line or generator outages are formulated as uncontrollable events. Synthesis procedures for DES-based supervisory controllers can then be applied to synthesize hierarchical control for large power networks},

The local decisions are transmitted to a central detector, the data fusion center (DEC), which integrates them to a global target or no target decision. Most studies of distributed-detection systems assume that the local detectors are synchronized. In practice local decisions are made asynchronously and the DFC has to update its global decision continually. In this study the number of local decisions observed by the central detector within any observation period is Poisson distributed. An optimal fusion rule is developed and the sufficient statistic is shown to be a weighted sum of the local decisions collected by the DFC within the observation interval. The weights are functions of the individual local detector performance probabilities (i.e., probabilities of false alarm and detection). In this respect the decision rule is similar to the one developed by Chair and Varshney for the synchronized system. Unlike the Chair-Varshney rule, however, the DFC{\textquoteright}s decision threshold in the asynchronous system is time varying. Exact expressions and asymptotic approximations are developed for the detection performance with the optimal rule.

In most studies, other statistical parameters are also assumed to be known, namely the a priori probabilities of the hypotheses, and the transition probabilities of DFC-LD channels. Under these circumstances, the DFC{\textquoteright}s sufficient statistic is a weighted sum of the local decisions. When these statistics are unknown, the authors propose to tune the weights on-line, guided by correct examples or by past experience. The authors develop a supervised training scheme that employs correct input-output examples to train the DFC. This scheme is then made into an unsupervised learning technique by replacing the examples with a self-assessment of the DFC, based on its own past decisions. In both cases the DFC minimizes the squared error between the actual and the desired values of its discriminant function. When supervised, the DFC obtains the desirable value from the supervisor. When unsupervised, the DFC estimates the desirable value from its last decision. This estimation includes rejection of data that is deemed unreliable.},

The DFC compresses the local decisions into a final binary decision. The objective function is the Bayesian risk. Equations for the optimal decision rules for the LDs and the DFC have been derived by Lee-Chao (1989), but the computational complexity of solving them is formidable. To address this difficulty, we propose several suboptimal LD-design schemes. For each one we design a DFC, which is optimally conditioned on the fixed LD rules. We calculate the exact performance of each scheme, thus providing a means for selection of the most appropriate one under given observation conditions. We demonstrate performance for two important binary decision tasks: discrimination between two Gaussian hypotheses of equal variances and different means; and discrimination between two Gaussian hypotheses of equal means and different variances},

	abstract = {The objective of the proposed classifier is the correct identification of a signal which belongs to a set of equally likely quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations and is received in additive noise. The parametric solution for this task which maximizes the average probability of correct decision is a maximum-likelihood (ML) classifier. However, this classifier needs the exact density function of the noise, which is often unknown. The alternative undertaken here is to develop a non-parametric classifier. Its decision statistic is the location of the first zero-crossing (FZC) in the characteristic function of the received symbols. The FZC-based classifier is inferior to the ML classifier in terms of the nominal performance. However, it puts only mild technical conditions on the probability density function of the noise and does not require additional information. Analytical expressions for the performance of the FZC-based classifier are derived, and performance is compared with that of the fully-informed ML classifier. The comparison is performed by evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of symbols that are needed for the two classifiers to have the same average correct-classification rate. Overall the FZC-based decision-maker provides a robust and practical alternative to the optimal, but often impractical, ML classifier.<>},

The weights are functions of the individual local detector performance probabilities (i.e., probabilities of false alarm and detection). Exact expressions and asymptotic approximations are developed for the performance of the DFC.

The echo-pulses from the surface and the sea bottom are used in order to calculate the depth of the ocean. We are interested in assessing the merits of using matched filtering for pulse detection and depth estimation algorithms. In this paper, we derive a filter matched to the expected shape of the ocean bottom return, which maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio for detection in additive white noise. The shape of the ocean bottom echo-pulses is based on a two dimensional analytical model of the light transmission characteristics of the water medium, where the effects of light propagation are represented geometrically by a cone of propagation. The performance of the matched filter is evaluated in terms of the Receiver Operating Characteristics and is compared with a sub-optimal filter which neglects the attenuation and scattering effects in the water medium. This comparison gives a figure of merit as to the improvement one can achieve using the matched filter, as a function of the ocean bottom{\textquoteright}s depth.},

Because many weighted arrays already employ controllable amplitude and phase (complex weighting), the compensation can be achieved with extra software. In order to calculate the compensation, the array factor of a planar uniform phased array is expressed in terms of the complex envelope of the signal that is communicated. This is performed for a phase-shifter based array and for a true-time-delay based array. The required correction is determined by approximating the directivity of the true-time-delay based array by the directivity of the phase-shifter based array.

The common implementation is with identical contiguous subarrays, which, due to periodicity, cause high sidelobes and grating lobes. We suggest to design divided arrays by trying random sizes of subarrays, with random locations of their centers, in order to avoid periodicity.

An association rule, which creates a sphere of influence around each stored pattern, is used along with the Machine{\textquoteright}s dynamics to match the machine{\textquoteright}s noisy input with one of the pre-stored patterns. Spurious fixed points, whose regions of attraction are not recognized by the rule, are skipped, due to the Machine{\textquoteright}s finite probability to escape from any state. b) We propose the use of the incremental Hebbian rule as a learning scheme for the Boltzmann-Machine-based content addressable memory. This learning rule is different from the probability-distribution-matching learning rules which are used at present for the Machine{\textquoteright}s weights in the global-minimizer application. We interpret the incremental Hebbian rule as a steepest-descent algorithm, maximizing the probability of pattern stabilization during learning. C) We describe the Hamming distance from a stored pattern using a birth-and-death Markov chain, and find bounds on the retrieval probabilities.

	abstract = {Summary form only given, as follows. An adaptive, neural network strategy is described for the control of a dynamic, locomotive system, in particular a one-legged hopping robot. The control task is to make corrections to the motion of the robot that serve to maintain a fixed level of energy (and minimize energy losses). While for many dynamic systems energy conservation may not be a key control criterion, legged locomotion is an energy intensive activity, implying that energy conservation is a primary issue in control considerations. The authors effect the control of the robot by the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) with a continuous learning memory. Results are presented in the form of computer simulations that demonstrate the ANN{\textquoteright}s ability to devise proper control signals that will develop a stable hopping strategy using imprecise knowledge of the current state of the robotic leg.<>},

	abstract = {A training algorithm for network of asynchronous learning-threshold elements is presented and analyzed. The algorithm is based on the Hebbian hypothesis, and it allows adaptation of the learning-network parameters to changing pattern environments. In particular, the network{\textquoteright}s properties can be quantified in environments where pattern occurrence is random, with nonequal, nonstationary probability distributions. The state reassessment probabilities of neurons during information retrieval can also be nonstationary and not equal for all neurons. The trained network is a content-addressable memory. The authors evaluate its stabilization properties with respect to a given set of patterns, using the theory of Markov processes. The results are applicable for the determination of efficient coding for information that has to be stored, and for prediction of actual pattern-retrieval capabilities of the trained network. The authors include the popular sum-of-outer-products assignment as an analyzable specific case of their training procedure, and allow the steady-state analysis of a large group of sigmoidal learning curves.<>},

The controller{\textquoteright}s complexity is expected not to grow exponentially with the number of unknown parameters, and to allow adaptation in both continuous and discrete parameter domains.

Most of the research pertaining to the network{\textquoteright}s state space so far concentrated on stable-state enumeration and often it was assumed that the patterns which are to be stored are random. We discuss the case of deterministic known codewords whose storage is required, and show that for this important case bounds on the retrieval probabilities and convergence rates can be achieved. The main tool which we employ is Birth-and-Death Markov chains, describing the Hamming distance of the network{\textquoteright}s state from the stored patterns. The results are applicable to both the asynchronous network and to the Boltzmann machine, and can be utilized to compare codeword sets in terms of efficiency of their retrieval, when the neural network is used as a content addressable memory.},

In this interpretation, the system{\textquoteright}s input is a transmitted message and the observation, or output, is the received message. Information-theoretic measures like entropy, mutual information and capacity can therefore be employed, and key concepts in system thery, such as observability, controllability and stability, can be expressed in information-theoretic terms. In this paper we study certain linear Markovian models from this viewpoint Observability of a Markovian linear discrete-in system is shown to be related to entropies of the initial state and the output observation. Stability is found to pertain to the capacity of the channel which represents the system. The derived relations expose the role of information flow in dynamical system behavior and suggest applications for other liner and nonlinear models.},

The purpose of this note is to obtain this probability density function through Shannon{\textquoteright}s dervation of the entropy measure and Jaynes{\textquoteright} maximum entropy principle.
